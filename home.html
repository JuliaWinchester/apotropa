		<p class="md-body-1">Hello, I'm Julie Winchester. I'm a biological anthropologist who specializes in bioinformatics of 3D data representing anatomical surfaces, most commonly teeth and bones. Currently I'm a post-doc with the <a class="gray-text" href="http://http://www.dougmboyer.com/">Boyer Lab</a> in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University. </p>

		<p class="md-body-1">My research interests concern the development of novel methods for analyzing 3D shape in broad samples of skeletal and dental specimens, and using quantified anatomical shape as a window to study form, function, phylogeny, and development in primates and other animals. See my <a class="gray-text" href="publication/">publications</a> for links to some of these studies. As part of my research, I am active in development of open-source software for 3D data analysis, and I am involved with strengthening infrastructure for the archiving and sharing of digital data. Primarily, I work with MorphoSource, a web archive for 3D data such as CT scan volumes or polygonal surface mesh models. I'm also currently participating in efforts to create linkages between scientific databases on the web through API development, with the goal of making it possible to easily access contextualized data from multiple sources. See my <a class="gray-text" href="#/code/">code and data page</a> for examples of software projects I've contributed to and digital datasets that I'm associated with.</p>
